# pubsynth

PubSynth is a website that was designed to make research easier and more accessible. By cutting out jargon and pulling key details from a number of sources, users are able to get the information they need without having to search through complicated texts themselves. With the ability to adjust the level of detail this content is written in, even the most technical topics can now be explored by anyone.

An API route is also made available via /api/results/<result_id> so that users can view their result information in JSON format.
