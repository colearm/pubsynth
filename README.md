PubSynth is a website that was designed to make research easier and more accessible. By cutting out the jargon and pulling key details from a number of sources, users are able to get the information they need without having to search through those complicated texts themselves. With the ability to adjust the level of detail this content is written in, topics that were once reserved for a select group of people may now be explored by anyone.
